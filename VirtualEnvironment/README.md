# Description

<br> A **virtual environment** was created to have a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python and number of additional packages. 
<br>It is simply a directory that contains a copy of the Python interpreter and all of the packages that are required for a particular project.
<br>It is a separate Python environment that has Python interpreter, libraries and scripts intalled into it and they are isolated from installed other virtual environment and from any librariers installed in your system.
<br>After activating a **virtual environment** for this project, this project becomes its own self contained application, independent of the system installed Python and its modules.
<br>A **requirement.txt** file is a file that contains a list of either packages or libraries needed to work on a project. It can be all installed with the file. It provides a consistent environment.
