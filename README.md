# Python Tutorial
This repository was designed to practise Python's libraries, frameworks, modules, methods and variables . 


## Scope of training

- **Dataclasses** - it is a Python's module to make structured class in particular for storing/holding data. It is used to store information that will be passes between different parts of a program or a system. It is a feature in Python 3.7 that provides a way to create data classes without the need to write methods.
- **if __name__ == "__main__"** - A short explanation of a __name__ variable and __main__ is the name of the environment where top-level code is run - module. 
- **Object-Oriented Programming Python** - OOP in Python is a method of structring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. It relies on objects. These objects can have attributes and methdos. While attributes store data, methods define behavior
- **Unit testing framwork** - it is a Python's framework that provides a set of tools for testing a code's functionality
- **Virtual environment** - a venv module creates and manages separate virtual environments for Python's projects. It simply creates an isolated space, it separates from your system-installed Python

## Definition

1. **Class** - it is a blueprint for creating objects. It also defines some properties and behaviors for objects. It is a collection of objects
2. **Object** - It is an instance of a class that possesses properties and behaviours. It is variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate data. An instance of a class is an object
3. **Method** - It is an action which an object is able to perform. It could be defined as functions that are associated with an object and it can manipulate its data or perform actions on it. It also defines the behaviour of Python's objects.
4. **Instance** - it is a specific realization of any object.
5. **Module** - A python module is a file (files with .py extensions) containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also have runnable code.
6. **Variable** - A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. It gives data to the computer for processing. It is a container for storing data values
7. **Decorator** - it is a design pattern in Python that allows programmers to add new functionality to an existing object without modyfing its structure. It modifies the behaviour of a function and class.
8. **Generator** - It allows to declare a function that behaves like an iterator for example it can be used in a for loop
9. **Attributes** - They are variables that belong to objects. It contains information about object's properties and characteristics. It shows details and facts related to the object.
10. **Python interpreter** - Python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out into code that the computer can understand
11. **Compiler** - A compiler is a software tool using which high-level programming code written by humans can be translated into machine-readable instructions. A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs.
12. **Interpreter** - An interpreter is a software tool that directly executes high-level programming code without prior translation into machine code. It reads and executes the code line by line, translating each line into machine instructions on the fly, making it easier to identify errors and debug the code.  An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs. 
13. **Constructor** - It is used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created
