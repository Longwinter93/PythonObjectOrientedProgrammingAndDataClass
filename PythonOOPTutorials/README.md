# PythonObjectOrientedProgramming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

For example, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.

Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees or students and teachers. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain operations.

Note: You can also check out the Python Basics: Object-Oriented Programming video course to reinforce the skills that youâ€™ll develop in this section of the tutorial.

The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python. In other programming paradigms, objects only represent the data. In OOP, they additionally inform the overall structure of the program.
