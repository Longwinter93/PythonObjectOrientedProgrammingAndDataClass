# Description

<br> **Unit tests** are segments of code written to test other pieces of code, typically a single function or method which refer to as a unit.
<br> The unitteste module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests. For example a testcase is created by subclassing _unittest.TestCase_
<br> The **assert** methods was used to check for and report failures
<br> The **setUp()** and **tearDown()** methods allow us to define instructions that will be executed before and after each test method

To run these tests from the command line, it it necessary to write this code on the terminal:
```
python -m unittest test_calc.py 
python -m unittest test_employee.py 
python -m unittest test_employee2.py 
python -m unittest test_employee3.py 
```

<br> To create this Unittest Python, these materials were used:
<br> [unittest - Unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
<br> [unittest.mock - mock object library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)
<br> [Test cases](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-cases)
